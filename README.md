My mind is rent asunder by the sands of time slipping inexorably through the flute of the hourglass. By which I mean my NLP training folder has gotten out-of-hand, and necessitates direct programmatic action. The only goal of #moonlapse is to systematize and organize my vast, disparate collection of NLP-related projects, knowledge, and code.

The best I can do is jam everything into a single top-level directory, and begin the process of massaging and systematizing a sort of neural-network of multi-media (human-centric) data.
